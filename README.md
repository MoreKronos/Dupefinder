# MP3 Organizer PowerShell Script

## Introduction

This PowerShell script automates organizing your MP3 files by moving them from a downloads folder to a music_files folder, removing duplicate tracks based on title metadata, and renaming numeric filenames to a consistent 5-digit zero-padded format.

**Note:** This project works only in conjunction with the **[Youtube-Toolkit project](https://github.com/MoreKronos/Youtube-Toolkit)**, as it relies on the folder structure and files created by that toolkit.

## Prerequisites

- Windows with PowerShell (v5+ recommended)
- The Youtube-Toolkit project set up properly
- downloads and music_files folders created by the Youtube-Toolkit

## Features

- Moves MP3 files from downloads to music_files
- Removes duplicate MP3 files based on Title metadata tag
- Renames numeric MP3 filenames to zero-padded 5-digit format (e.g., 12.mp3 â†’ 00012.mp3)
- Creates a duplicates_found.flag file if duplicates are found and removed

## Usage

- Place the PowerShell script inside the scripts folder within your project directory.
- Make sure the **[Youtube-Toolkit](https://github.com/MoreKronos/Youtube-Toolkit)** has downloaded files into the downloads folder.
